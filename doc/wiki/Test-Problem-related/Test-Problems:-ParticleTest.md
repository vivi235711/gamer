# Compilation flags
- Must enable
   - [[MODEL=HYDRO | Installation: Simulation-Options#MODEL]]
   - [[PARTICLE | Installation: Simulation-Options#PARTICLE]]
   - [[GRAVITY | Installation: Simulation-Options#GRAVITY]]
   - [[TRACER | Installation: Simulation-Options#TRACER]]
   - [[SUPPORT_HDF5 | Installation: Simulation-Options#SUPPORT_HDF5]]
- Must disable
   - [[COMOVING | Installation: Simulation-Options#COMOVING]]
- Available options
   - [[Miscellaneous Options | Installation: Simulation-Options#miscellaneous-options]]


# Default setup
1. Maximum refinement level ([[MAX_LEVEL | Runtime-Parameters:-Refinement#MAX_LEVEL]] = 3)
2. Both massive and tracer particles enabled

# Note
1. Test particle capabilities: 2-body circular orbit for massive particles, a
   lattice of tracer particles which rotates due to a circular velocity field
   from the fluid with constant angular frequency
2. Set `ParTest_Use_Tracers = 1` to use tracer particles, `ParTest_Use_Massive = 1`
   to use massive particles. At least one must be enabled.
3. No need to set `PAR_NPAR` in `Input__Parameter` since it will be reset automatically.
3. `OPT__FREEZE_FLUID` must be 1 for this test.
4. If `OPT__FLAG_USER` is set, a rectangle will be refined in the center of the
   domain.
> [!NOTE]
> The active particle orbit is _not_ stable in this case due to self-force at refinement boundaries.
5. Density of the gas must be kept very small to avoid gravitational effects from the gas.
6. Use python script `make_tracer_pngs.py` with yt to make PNG images, use
   bash script `make_tracer_movie.sh` to combine PNGs into movies with ffmpeg.
