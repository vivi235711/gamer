Enable : MODEL=HYDRO, GRAVITY
Disable: COMOVING


Default setup:
========================================


Note:
========================================
1. Test the evolution of the Plummer model
   --> Plummer_Collision = 0: test the stability of a single Plummer cloud
                           1: test the collision of two Plummer clouds
2. One can set NCOMP_PASSIVE_USER = 2 for Plummer_Collision == 1
   --> Different clouds will be assigned with different passive scalars
3. Plummer cloud(s) can have both gas and particles
   --> Plummer_GasMFrac: gas mass fraction
4. To enable feedback:
   (1) Enable FB_USER
   (2) Enable Plummer_FB_Exp and/or Plummer_FB_Acc
5. To test mass conservation to the machine precision with mass accretion feedback:
   (1) Set Plummer_FB_ExpMMax = 0.0 (no mass loss in explosion feedback)
   (2) Set OPT__BC_FLU_* = 1 (periodic BC)
   (3) Use the gnuplot script "plot_script/plot_mass.gpt"
